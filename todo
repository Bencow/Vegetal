////////////////Creation of the squeleton :

Solve the problem of null vectors
- dot product equation
- try to find when qnd in which conditions are they created

Several problems come up with the new solution : 
	- the tree is globably growing in one direction (because it first tries if z==0 then y==0) -> not balanced solution
	- still null vectors...
	- collisions

Find a realistic condition to create new branches
	OK, works but i can still find more realistic function, good at the beginning but after 10 count, grow exponantially, we don't want that, my function just delay the exponantial...
	but why not we'll do only 5 updates max

Avoid branches to go under the root...

Add the leaves squeleton


//////////////////////////////Adding volumes and forms :

- Tuto geometry shader

- print only the vertex (dots)

- print a form for each vertex : circle, sphere, line with the next one(then cylinder), triangle, cube...

- print leaves

//////////////////////////////Animation :
- find a function to make all the vertex move with the wind (depending of the hight ?)
